<h1>Web-Based Applications Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><b>Jensen Lobo</b> is a student in UNCC who is majoring in computer science with a concentration in software engineering.
I like to play sports and love to bake desserts. </p>

<p><b> I</b> choose this course because I want to learn how to make a website. I have tried to make a website using html and css before but I struggled with it. Hopefully by taking this class I'll be able to make a website all by myself.</p>

<p><em>Some of my strategies to be successful in this course is to make sure that I am on top of all of my assignments. I will also try to ask for help when I need it. I will also make sure to start assignments/projects early to make sure I can space out my work.</em></p>
